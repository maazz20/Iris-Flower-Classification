Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning
This project applies Machine Learning to classify iris flowers into three species:
Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica

It uses Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier for prediction, with data visualization to analyze patterns in the dataset.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and renaming columns for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Pairplots & statistical summaries.
Model Training: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report.
New Data Prediction: Predicts iris species based on input features.

Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling & manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models
